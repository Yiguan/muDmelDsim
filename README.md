The mutation, recombination and transposition rate of the African *D. melanogaster*, European *D. melanogaster* and *D. simulans*



The main pipeline we used is included in the pipeline folder: `main_v2.Rmd`; the related scripts are included in `src` foler.

The repository doesn't aim for general purpose and some are hard-coded in the scripts. So be cautious when using it, or post an Issue if you encounter some problems.
